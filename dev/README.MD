###Development Code

This directory contains the files used to develop the fendR package. How can we keep these included in the repo but not the package?

So far this is limited to:
* formatCcleData.R: a script that pulls data from cBioPortal and pushes matrices to Synapse and to inst directory
* exampleForestRun.R: a script that runs through the forest implementation of fendR
