### Test ability to recover known drug efficacies on all drugs
This test is medium-ambitious - see if we can bracket cell lines by efficacy of a particular drug and then recover that drug, while testing _every drug_ that is in the DTEX database.

### Results
Results are not that great, with all possible parameters occuring here:
* [CCLE Drug results](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn12000477/tables/)
* [Sanger Drug results](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn12104377/tables/)
* [pNF Drug results](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn12209124/tables/)

### Summary plots
Relatively uninformative parameter testing can be found [here](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn12104372)
