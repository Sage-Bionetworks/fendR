# fendr: From Expression (to) Novel Drug Response
This package represents our attempts to identify novel drugs and/or targets from transcriptomic and/or genomic data. 

## Prior Work
We built an [R test suite](./R) to compare various network based approaches based on networks built by the Guan/Troyanskaya labs

## Ongoing work
We are currently experimenting with:

1- Incorporating @allaway's drug-target network to quantify putative drug targets of novel drugs
2- Mapping gene expression data to proteins in the protein and or drug-target interaction networks

See [development](./dev/) Directory for latest plans and updates
